1. run `./compile` to compile brute-force algorithm. 
2. run `./newData.py` to generate input files. 
3. run `spark-submit sampling.py -g` (`-h` for all arguments) to run the sampling algorithm. 
4. Standard result is in `standard.txt`. 
5. Result from sampling algorithm is in the 1st line of `result.txt` while error is in the 2nd.
